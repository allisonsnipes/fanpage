        Parcels are signed to the French label Kitsuné. Their single "Overnight", released on 21 June 2017, was produced by Daft Punk; who heard them at their first performance in France. Daft Punk invited them to their LA studio, and requested to hear some demo tracks that they'd been working on. Daft Punk was inspired by 'Overnight', and they proceeded to work towards recording and releasing the single with Parcels. In an interview, Parcel's keyboardist Patrick said “First we spent seven days in the studio with them, every day from 12 midday up until 4 in the morning, literally working on it overnight."
